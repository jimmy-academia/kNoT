The texture of the shake is perfect, frothy and milky but not too thin.  One of the best parts of the shake is when you reach the bottom, there's still lots of chocolate pieces to be enjoyed.\n\nOther shakes\\/ice cream flavors are also quite good.  The coconut ice cream is chock-full of fresh coconut flakes, making for a powerful and delicious flavor.  The Hydrox Cookie is full of chocolate and cream flavors, and also goes quite well in a shake.\n\nAs for sundaes, the Mount Vesuvius and the Franklin Mint are both delicious.  The Mount Vesuvius is a brownie fudge sundae and is supremely rich and delicious.  Brownies are freshly-baked an warm, as is the hot fudge.  Vanilla and chocolate ice cream are the perfect bases for this delicious sundae.  The Franklin Mint features vanilla bean ice cream, topped with hot fudge, cr√®me de menthe sauce, and the same delicious chocolate in the mint shake.  It is great also.\n\nIn the winter, given the chilly temperatures in Philly, Franklin Fountain unveils an innovative and delicious Winter menu.  The S'mores hot milkshake on the winter menu is phenomenal.  This shake features vanilla bean ice cream mixed with  a warm, homemade graham cracker, homemade marshmallows flamed to toasty, and hot fudge.  The end result is a beautiful product that tastes like warm melting ice cream.  It is fantastic as all the flavors come together beautifully.\n\nFranklin may often have a wait, but it is completely worth waiting for every time for the outrageously good milkshakes and sundaes."", 'Today I went to Franklin Fountain for the second time since moving to Philadelphia. While the ice cream is delicious, the experience I had today was far from satisfactory. After waiting in a very long line that extended outside the store and down the street, I finally reached the door. A woman walking along the street walked straight into the store, ignoring the line and cut right in front of me. \n\nAt first, we thought she was meeting someone who was holding a spot for her or in a rush to use the bathroom. When we noticed that this was not the case, my boyfriend said ""excuse me"" twice to the woman, who turned her back and ignored him. I got her attention and said ""excuse me ma\'am, but you\'ve just cut a very long line."" Her response was, ""I\'m deaf."" I repeated my comment to her loud enough that the entire staff could hear. The staff appropriately asked her if she had, indeed, cut the line, to which she responded, ""I\'m mentally ill. I have PTSD."" The staff offered to show her to the end of the line and she responded by saying, ""No, I just want ice cream."" \n\nIn the end, the woman was not forced to wait her turn, like all of the other customers had to, and she even signaled for a man outside to come cut the line with her.  She told him ""They said it\'s ok!"" and he too, rudely cut in front of me and everyone else. \n\nFranklin Fountain needs to learn to respect its customers and enforce common courtesy. I understand that the blame is really on this woman, but I am disappointed and offended that she and was still served. She may very well be mentally ill like she said, but she gives PTSD sufferers who understand how to wait in line a bad name.', ""Hydrox cookie is the original Oreo! And the better looking one  so delicious! All their flavors taste on point and you can't go wrong. Love love this place. Their sister shop, Shane confectionery, has the best ice cream sandwiches.

But we ate the bread, fried apples and okra which was good and thought we had just went it late and blamed it on that. The next visit my sister ordered fried chicken that was so overcooked she could hardly bite it and my turkey and dressing was not at all what it use to be , tasted like frozen turkey over  highly salted and seasoned bread and once again covered in canned gravy.  I had slaw that had  gone bad or tasted bad like it had sat out and soured. Once again we blamed it on an off day and ate coconut pie that was great.   The we decided to try again today. I did notice when we went in that it was almost empty and it was lunch time when in past years, you had to wait for a table,   We had meat loaf  mac and cheese and green beans.   The mac and cheese was soured wit the same bad taste of soured milk or cheese that had been in the slaw they last visit, We shoved it aside and starting eating the meat loaf only to find it RAW in the center, That took out appetite away , We ate the green beans that were good corn muffin that was passable.   I told the waitress and showed her the raw meatloaf and she went and told the manager and cook, They did take 4 or 5 dollars off the $23.89  plus tip bill, Really that was too much for what we could eat which was a corn bread muffin and okra for my sister and green beans and corn muffin for me.

Another time I asked a different artist if she could have someone take a short video of her tattooing me since I didn\'t have anyone with me that could. She made it seem like she would but then proceeded to finish the tattoo and completely ignored my request. Like if she was uncomfortable with it she should have been up front about that instead of completely disregarding my wishes. And yet again another time I went I was told to wait about 40 minutes to be seen for a walk in but then I waited for over an hour because they forgot\\/assumed I wasn\'t there to get tattooed.

He was extremely friendly and professional, wore a mask the whole time we interacted. My tattoo probably took 15 min, and he chatted with me off and on throughout that time. He made me feel comfortable and again he was super professional. I wouldn\'t hesitate to recommend him because I had a great first experience.

I said it wasn\'t me to go back through the store for her mistake. As soon as I said that another employee walked by and said he would pick more frames. As he was doing so the cashier turned her back to me, began talking to the neighboring cashier loud enough for me to hear. The neighboring cashier looked at me and snipped ""I would wait until they went and got them."" I spoke to a supervisor on the spot who said that wasn\'t protocol and he would talk to the cashier. Two evenings ago I went back to Ikea to use my birthday meal voucher and shop the store. At 6:30 the line for the food was reaching the soda area. Only one side of food serving was open and the few people working didn\'t seem to have any urgency about moving the line. Two cashiers sat idle because the line wasn\'t moving. I asked one cashier what the problem was and she shook her head and said they ran out of food and had to cook more. She suggested I go downstairs for food or across the parking lot to Chic-fil-a. So my family and I walked the store hoping the line would be better when we returned. at 7:10 we returned to a slightly shorter line. We decided to eat. Once in line we saw a completely empty cake display. Not one cake of any type. And I was supposed to receive a free piece of cake. Then we went to pick our food. No Salmon.

I went in with high expectations as this restaurant is always so well regarded by our circle of friends, so imagine our excitement when they had availability on Christmas Eve.  We arrived a little early for our reservations, we checked in with the hostess and then never apprised again on what would be happening next. No, ""you\'re early, please wait, thank you"" or ""we\'ll be seating you after these other patrons, thank you for waiting"".  We were just completely ignored. The majority of the menu is devoted to pushing cocktails and wines.  I thought this was a restaurant?  and the reveillon menu insisted that everyone at the table participate, but there weren\'t even options within that menu to make it a feasible situation.  We also happened to be seated across from Tarik Hanna, so since we aren\'t cool enough New Orleaneans we were just left to ourselves.  The small plate\\/appetizers looked mainly just like sides and not actually appetizers. No thoughtful and creative small plates, No salads, no soup options, nothing of the sort.  My spouse tried the fried hogs head cheese which he actually enjoyed.  The crusty bread that was presented to our table was excellent.  The beef option was sold out (!), so my spouse had the gulf fish which was basically just covered in tarragon - no salt, no seasoning of any kind, no beurre blanc.  Just a wedge of tasteless white fish covered with green herbs.  It was awful.  I tried a bite because my entree was so underwhelming that I was hoping maybe I just made a poor choice and my husband had better luck.  Nope, it was gross.  I opted with the chicken schnitzle because since I felt robbed of having an appetizing appetizer, I thought it might be something to eat that might be substantial.  It was basically just one big chicken tender with a sprinkling of tasteless raw cabbage salad on top.  The most horrifying thing about the schnitzle is that it was undercooked and still raw in places, so I ate around and prayed I wouldn\'t wind up with food poisoning for Christmas.  We asked about the desserts and the pecan pie with butterscotch sounded like they bought some pecan pie tarts and added some garnish to it, and the apple dessert sounded like a couple of scoops of sherbet with some apple wedges added to it to make it seem like they put some effort into their desserts.  We passed.  Again, the dessert menu was mainly devoted to liquor options.  My spouse was so offended by the wine menu with no glasses under $14 that we just enjoyed our bottle water (which we served and refilled ourselves).  Our bill wound up only being like $80, and we were prepared to spend way more - but the lack of appetizers, the ridiculously priced wine options, the boring desserts, we decided Coquette was not worth our investment.  Honestly, we wound up spending double that at the dive-y Royal China on Vets the next day and much more satisfied than with the fancier and more pretentious Coquette.  Just sayin.', 'coquette is top notch.  everything we had was fantastic and we left extremely pleased and content.  my mom got the tasting menu which was: hamachi sashimi, collard green ravioli, scallops, and a old fashioned donut desert.  all were on point and well prepared.  i had the sweet potato gnocchi appetizer, which was the best of all.  the chicken i had for the entree was delicious, with brussel sprouts and baby turnips.  it was actually really well cooked chicken.  my brother had the oyster stew, which was more like fried oysters with an ""oyster stew"" sauce - the stew was very thick and rich, but it was damn good.  he ordered the fish dish and i can\'t remember which kind of fish (maybe redfish or snapper) but he said it wasn\'t the best he\'s ever had but it was well prepared.\n\ni\'d return here for sure.  i thoroughly enjoyed sitting at the bar - it\'s a pretty fantastic bar with tons of room.  the service, wine selection all were well done.  kudos.  but don\'t expect to see anything from the above experience because the menu changes constantly.  which is a plus.', 'I went here for a ""no menu Tuesday"" tasting menu and was not disappointed.  Five courses and I opted for the wine pairing.  First course was a blood pudding with sunflower seeds, popped sorghum, root beer and edible flowers paired with a sparking gruner veltliner (never had one of these before).  I was hooked on this place immediately.  Everything was wonderful and very reasonably priced for a tasting menu with pairings.', 'Amazing! We ate here for Sunday Brunch and had the Eggs Benedict. Wonderful choice. It had a spectacular mix of flavors that was so well paired even down to the tiny garlic\\/onion flowers. Coquette never disappoints.  Great atmosphere and friendly waitstaff.', ""This restaurant is so pretentious. We reserved a table using the open table app, after looking at their menu. The menu was completely different once we got there and didn't meet some of our party's dietary needs, so instead of leaving we ordered appetizers and drinks then headed out. The staff was talking about us three feet away and then when we left they cancelled our open table reservation so we couldn't leave a review on there and cancelled our points even though we spent money at their establishment. I've never felt more uncomfortable in a restaurant.""]",4

Opted to try again.  Not a great experience tonight either, and i very rarely leave reviews.  We were sat by someone who didn\'t welcome or really acknowledge us - just asked ""only 2?"".  Sat us with no welcome or introduction and went over to talk with another server in another section (not our server).  Im guessing we were our server\'s last table for the night by the lack of interest or focus ( we arrived at 7:45 - not late).  She spent as little time at the table as possible.  No offer of specials, what brought us in, or really any sense that we were welcome.   Food was mediocre for $50 dinner for 2.  Bill was brought before we were done eating.  We are scratching outback off the list for options and this location for sure.  Nice building - just seems that no one tonight really cared or was busy worrying about other stuff.  We and another couple walk between the same host who sat us on the way out and another server.  Both are too engrossed in conversation to wish anyone a good night or offer to hold the door.  Not good service, poor attitudes, this chain is doomed if this is the culture in other outbacks.  Makes me sad as 10-15 years ago i remember looking forward to visiting my then local outback and knowing it would be a really great meal and experience.  Maybe this was a bad night for them, maybe I\'m being overly critical, but felt it was worth sharing if anyone else was thinking of giving outback another chance like us.', ""So we were actually going to the Olive Garden across the street tonight 3-5-19 for dinner but they had a really long wait so we went across the street to eat here at the Outback. We arrive and there were 3 hosts at the door and they asked if we wanted to go to the bar and we declined and they then told us that it would be about 30 minutes if we wanted to sit in the main dining room even though it was more than half empty. So we opted to sit in the bar area when they said there was a server on the floor and it wasn't the bartender actually waiting tables. The server came quickly to get our drink order and we told her we wanted to start with a blooming onion. She put it in and it came out rather quickly. Now these onions are definitely always greasy but not soaked in grease so we barely touched them and moved the plate to the side of the table. A good server would have taken notice of that and asked was their something wrong with it but not our server. So I ordered the Ribeye and asked for medium well. It came out closer to medium rare so I flagged down the manager and he took it back to cook it longer. And I told him I ordered loaded baked potato and there were maybe 3 little pieces of bacon and a very tiny amount of cheese on there so he said he would take care of that too. He came back pretty quickly with my plate and it still wasn't cooked the way I wanted it but I wasn't sending it back again. I noticed other tables around us complaining as well so it wasn't just us. We had stopped going to this restaurant a few years back for this reason so it's not likely we will go back because nothing has changed."", ""I can't believe this place has such a poor rating. I had another great dinner here with the fam! The food and service were both great.  The boys ordered unlimited shrimp that the attentive waitress kept bringing; the crispy shrimp was the favorite. The mom had salmon, the rest of us had steaks. If you haven't signed up for dine rewards, you should. I used a 20% off coupon (counted as a dine rewards visit-not redemption, so there was no limit to the savings-we saved $30).

So far, she (the waitress) is being very kind. Right now we appreciate her. As it turns out, I gotta give it to her.

After five awkward minutes of feeling like scolded children, the server came back and said that she would let us sit there (was she doing us a favor?) but if someone wanted the table to eat, then she would move us.  I said, ""Even though two of the four of us are eating?"" and she said, very condescendingly, ""Sweetheart, you\'re just eating SALADS.""  I was completely offended and flabbergasted - it was a really hostile tone from our server for no apparent reason - there were no parties waiting for tables, it was 10 PM, and we actually HAD ordered food.  We joked that we should have engaged in a philosophical argument about what dinner constituted.\n\nNeedless to say that we were feeling pretty uncomfortable and so we left.

It was my first time to the restaurant since it was updated and revamped and became Pub and Kitchen.  Upon looking at the menu I realized there were not many Vegetarian options.  i asked our waiter if the kitchen could alter an entree and make it Veg friendly for me....and he snidely suggest I try the side of brussel sprouts.  I explained I was more hungry then for just a small side plate and he simple repeated himself, ""your best bet are the brussel sprouts.""  Such a bummer.  I used to frequent this place when it was Chaucer\'s.  Just walking in the door made me feel nostalgic.  I really wanted to enjoy my dinner there.  I would give Pub and Kitchen a second chance cause I am a forgiving lady, but I do hope they would be slightly more accommodating to someone with dietary restrictions.

I'm curious as to what cheese they used for the 3 cheese sauce though because it tasted slightly artificial but we still were on the verge of licking the plate. The crudit√©s was beautiful and delicious. The bacon was finger licking good but I think the presentation could use a little work, as it was just a bunch of bacon strips carelessly tossed on a plate.

We would load the whole table with yummy enjoyment! They had this amazing and creative food with incredible flavor and spices! ....But they changed their whole menu! Not just part! The whole menu!

Just raw slummy balls of tuna with mango and avocado thrown together in a martini glass. Nothing special here! But to top it off its served with these chips that are so unappetizing looking you're nearly grossed out by just looking at them. They are white styrofoam looking chips with black spots assumed to be sesame seeds. I'm curious is anyone who serves this nasty concoction has tried one? It not only doesn't look like food or anything you would want to eat, I tried to eat one and it tasted like eating styrofoam, totally uneatable!

As they didn't come to the table to follow up with any questions or comments, even though we were the only ones in the whole restaurant. The server said, yeah but chefs don't like to have complaints on their food! So sad! I guess the new Chef with the new menu isn't interested in feedback! I was only trying to make suggestions or comments since the Chef and menu are new. I thought the comments would have been welcomed, especially when they were so slow and no one else was in the restaurant.

We arrived at 9:55am, were promptly seated and given menus. In about 10 minutes our order was taken. There were 2 tables busy, one with 6 people and one with 2. There were numerous unbussed tables. A party of 7 came in about 10 minutes after we were seated. There were 3 waitresses, 3 in the kitchen, and a guy at the bar (that I could see).\n\nWe placed our order with Irene- 2 dutch babies, the special hash, breakfast ramen, omelette, 2 coffees, a blueberry soda, 2 OJ and water all around. According to the ticket our order was put in at 10:14a.\n\nWe got our waters. And then waited. And waited. At 10:35 we got our drinks, minus the blueberry soda, served to us by someone who wasn\'t even a waiter. He said the blueberry soda was being made. And we waited. And two of the party went up to the rooms to get our stuff and check out because by 10:40 we had not yet gotten our food. Or the blueberry soda. The bartender is sometimes there, but not making our drinks.\n\nIn this time the other table of 7 that had been seated after us was starting to get their food already.\n\nA different waitress with a pony tail came by and I asked her about the soda. She said she\'d check on it. Never heard back.\n\n10 minutes later our waitress brought the 2 dutch babies and the hash, but we were still missing the omelette and the ramen. It\'s 10:50a. I asked AGAIN about the blueberry soda. The waitress said the manager was supposed to be making it at the bar. But he was nowhere to be seen. I also asked for salt and pepper.\n\n10:55: Asked pony tail waitress for salt and pepper. (Never got it).\n\nAt 11:03 the rest of the food arrived. No soda. And they brought 2 ramens. We sent the extra one back. We asked for salt and pepper again. About 5 minutes later I had to go to one of the unbussed tables and get it myself. 15 minutes for s&p I had to get myself.\n\nFinally I asked again about the soda and finally it came.\n\nThe food is different from the usual eggs, but it\'s nothing special, especially for the incredibly long wait, and the breakfast ramen was a miss as it was not very flavorful. The blueberry soda that we waited so long for was just blueberries muddled with soda water and some simple syrup. Not terribly blueberry-y tasting, and certainly not worth the 45+ minutes!\n\nThen the bill came. They charged us for the extra ramen we never ordered and sent back. So I told the pony tail waitress and she took the bill to adjust it. (Never heard back)\n\n10 minutes later our waitress Irene came back to check on us and I told her about the bill. She took off our drinks for the mistake and gave us a new bill. It\'s 11:10 and we have been there since 9:50 trying to get through breakfast. I asked her what she would do in my position regarding a tip. She said they were terribly understaffed and that she was doing everything.\n\nAt this point, it\'s obvious I was unhappy, and the manager should have stepped in, especially since she already had to comp us the drinks because of mistakes and bad timing. But he was nowhere to be seen.\n\nShe took the bill back, found him and we were given 40% off and a card for free appetizers in the future.\n\nI gave her a decent tip and we left.\n\nThoughts: \n\nThe manager should have been there to hear our complaints, not the waitress. That\'s his job, not hers. After the drinks were comped because of poor service, he should have come over to talk to us.\n\nOur waitress Irene was very nice and obviously rushed, but there were 2 other waitresses milling around. And everything we said to the ponytail waitress was ignored or not acted on (no soda, no salt\\/pepper, no updated check).\n\nI know it\'s not the waitress\' fault the food was so incredibly late. That is why I tipped our waitress. She did her job. The other waitress did not. The kitchen- really slow and to have our food come out in 2 batches over 10 minutes, that\'s just poor organization and skill.\n\nThe manager is also the bartender. If he lets his customers wait over 40 minutes for a blueberry soda, he\'s not good at either of his roles.\n\nIn the end, it\'s a restaurant attached to a hotel that touts itself as a ""luxurious boutique hotel."" We certainly did not get that impression from the restaurant. A Labor Day weekend, with 30K+ people from Burning Man coming into town and bad service? Poor planning. There were about 20 people total the whole time we were there, at 4 tables. 3 waitresses, 3 cooks, no bussing staff, one missing manager\\/bartender. Dismal.\n\nReno needs a nice upscale restaurant like this that isn\'t attached to a casino. But I think that the management is poorly chosen. I hope they take this review to heart and work things out because I\'d love to be able to come back and have a good experience. They serve foie gras at dinner (which, to us deprived Californians, is a great thing), and I look forward to hopefully trying it.']",6

Take my word for it. Super cool decor, drink offerings, and outstanding food."", ""I have been wanting to try Kings Street Food Counter for a little while now- and I was not disappointed.  First- atmosphere- I really dig it.  I will be coming back to hang out and have drinks here one afternoon in the near future. The outside patio is fantastic and could become my summer go to hang out. \n\nI love the concept of sit down restaurants serving street food-and glad to see them popping up more around St. Pete.  I tried my first order of poutine ever (a Canadian delicacy that my southern accent makes sound ridiculous and maybe a little dirty).  It is something that I have wanted to try for a long time.  I ordered the 'El Jeffe' which is crispy fries, fire roasted tomatoes, roasted jalape√±os, and quest blanco. It was good.  I think it might be interesting if they used sweet pickled jalape√±os- but regular ones worked nicely.  I split the order with my friend and it works out well as an appetizer. \n\nI then ordered the 'Green Thumb Grilled Cheese' which is swiss cheese, red onion, avocado, tomato,cucumber, carrots, and thousand island dressing.  It was also quite tasty. This was recommend by the waitress when I told her I was vegetarian.  I have to admit I was a little hesitant - I had never had avocado on a melt before- it was good. There are like four more sandwiches I want to try- and I can't wait to decided which one is my favorite.  \n\nMy lunch companion ordered the 'Elvis Press-ley' which is peanut butter, banana,\napplewood smoked bacon, and nutella.  It all sounds like too much for me- but she loved it.  I have seen a whole movie (What If) devoted to the kings fried PB&B&B sandwiches known as fools gold colloquially - something has to be good about them.  I am just not that big a fan of peanut butter. \n\nWhich makes this last paragraph that much more surprising.  My friend and I had a dank milk shake split into two glasses for dessert.  I let her choose the flavor choice and she chose a peanut butter one described as tasting like captain crunch cereal.  Let me say- to my surprise- I really enjoyed it. \n\nLastly - paper straws! My friends at the Plastic Pollution Coalition (www.plasticpollutioncoalition.org) have been preaching to me about the evils of plastic straws for years.  I do not usually use straws so it is not a worry that I have- but I get irritated when people provide me an unsolicited plastic straw.  One of my best friends carries with steel straws with her to avoid having to ever use plastic ones.  But it is so nice to go to a restaurant that is at the forefront of environmental issues.  Major Kudos to the King Street Food Counter for being leaders on this issue!\n\nI am looking forward to coming back to the joint- and becoming a regular. Monday night has a dinner special (See photo) that I fully plan to exploit!"", ""My first time there was a slow Monday. I live down the road so I thought I'd stop in and try them out.

I did not order a drink. Just wait at the counter for my food. \n\nIt took close to 20 minutes before my food came out. The female had tied the bag up so that I would have had to break the bag open to check my food. I did not have the time or patience to do that so I trusted my food was correct and left.\n\nI was wrong. The corned dogs were so over fried that the cornmeal was dried out and greasy at the same time.\n\nAnd my Philly I ordered with NO mushrooms had so many mushrooms that I could not eat it. It was overloaded with mushrooms and the onions and peppers. Barely any meat. Extremely disappointing, especially since I gave the female a $4 tip on a to-go order slightly under $20. \n\nThe price was way too high for what you get, the food was disgusting as well as wrong, AND the female could not even take the time to double check the order before handing it to me. \n\nI hate leaving poor reviews but I will definitely not be back.

Lots on tap and a ton of IPA's and such in bottles.  Kudos for a great beer menu.\n\nSo she opted for the chicken sandwich and she said it wasn't a typical chicken patty...it was real chicken breast...moist, well flavored and delish.  I opted for the cheesesteak.  I always shake off the onions and peppers and just opt for lettuce and tomato instead.  I requested this and as the gal brought out her chicken sandwich, she verified I requested no onion and pepper.  I confirmed and she said the kitchen had put some on mine, and she would get me a new order asap.  For my 'trouble' she bought me a beer (Rolling Rock bottle), which was totally cool and not necessary, but certainly appreciated.

The broth is light and not filled with nauseating fat. The noodles have such great texture and consistency, not too soft nor hard, retaining a sort of bounciness. Even the toppings of onions and scallions were quite fresh and worth noting.

While I was waiting at the soup counter I was told they had no bacon... I asked if they would have more soon. I was told they would bring me the soup, so clearly they had bacon somewhere.

At this point I asked for a manager, who had been standing there the whole time and responds with what are you still waiting for? I then told her I was somehow still missing the French toast and needed my omelet to be remade for a third time. When I finally received the omelet with the right ingredients it was cooked horribly with way too much spinach which made it extremely watery. We finally received the French toast which was a cinnamon bun, not regular French toast. When I said that wasn't what we ordered, I was told that's how their French toast always looks.

He made the experience wonderful and I would easily go back again! \n\nHe is also one of the best cheese makers!', ""I went here for my boyfriend's birthday and I had been to the Philadelphia location a few times before so I knew he would love it. I have no complaints about the food or the service. We had a great time and the waitress was super nice and made it fun for us. However, our way home from dinner we both started to feel off but we had just assumed we had eaten too much and went to bed. We woke up in the middle of the night with terrible food poisoning. We weren't sure what was going on because we kept the food cooking for longer than the recommended time, just to be safe. Since I had been to the Philadelphia location and I didn't see anyone else who had this experience, I chalked it up to a one time thing. My main problem was with how they handled it. I called the restaurant the next day when I was feeling better and all I wanted was for them to tell me they would look into the issue just so no one else would get sick, but she just insisted that they food poisoning wasn't from their restaurant! And then she offered to send me a gift card to come back. After I just spent hours vomiting the last thing I wanted to think about was going back. And it was especially frustrating because we had spent so much money on a nice meal just to get sick and then the manager was not at all understanding. This whole experience was about a month ago and I was hesitant to write a review because I did have a good time there and I do think it was a one time incident  but the management was a big problem for me."", ""My boyfriend and I visited The Melting Pot for the first time on Friday.

I was sad to see the Philadelphia location move and even sadder to see the Atlantic City location close. Those events kind of set the fire to get my butt in the door here! My sister-in-law and I decided that we would hit the happy hour so we could check it out casually. It has been many years since I had visited a Melting Pot location. It was very quiet at 4 when the happy hour started. We opted to sit at the bar. We positioned ourselves between two stations because we knew we were going to get more than one fondue. The bartender slash server was extremely attentive, nice, and funny too. She went over all of our options for both the fondues and the beverages. We ordered some drinks which were fantastic. I ordered a signature cocktail that was made impeccably. My sister-in-law just got her usual, but it was made perfectly to order. We got the Alpine cheese and the Brie and bacon cheese fondue. I like them both but I definitely prefer the Alpine which was okay because my sister-in-law preferred the Brie and bacon. We also got the signature Meats for dipping as well. Everything was super delicious and presented just the way I would expect from a Melting Pot location. We even opted for dessert as it was happy hour and those two were $5 each we got the turtle and I have to tell you I never order dessert and this thing was just spectacular. I would say the service is over and above and the food is superior quality. I'm excited to come back for a proper sit down dinner. For those who feel like the Melting Pot is too expensive for dinner I highly suggest you hit the happy hour. It will give you the fondue experience at a lower cost. I can't say enough about the yin yang martini LOL it is my hands-down favorite and I hate sweet drinks. Just get it you'll understand. So happy we went and I'm very excited to come back.

That being said, I really didn\'t like what happened at Maplewood tonight. I wanted to surprise my mom by taking her to her favorite restaurant (which would be you) I had heard really great things and was happy that Maplewood took over Osterias spot in Moorestown. When my mom and I arrived, we were seated in the absolute furthest region back, away from the dining room. While having a significant other who is a chef, a friend who worked her way through college as a waitress I knew what this room was. It\'s where you seat people you don\'t really want seen in your establishment, people who are deemed as most likely not going to tip well. I originally thought ""oh. Must be due to Covid"" but having looked at the empty dining room, passing a member of your staff explaining to another member of your staff exactly what that area is for (no kidding. It was like the twilight zone) my intention was to purchase appetizers, wine, meals, and desserts but after a while of sitting there I thought ""well, I don\'t think I\'m going to give these guys my money."" . So I left and gave my business to a local place (I should have done that already). I might give this place another shot eventually, but the way you treated my mom (not even me, who cares how you treat me) was offensive, out dated, and just over all hurtful. I know Covid has everything screwed up and confusing, but this was no way to treat someone.', ""Have eaten here twice since they opened and loved the place both times.Have eaten at other Maplewood's before and  this is the nicest one in terms of atmosphere.Food was very much like other Maplewood's,ie delicious.\nTheir sauce is among the tastiest I've ever had and their menu is extensive.Service was fine on both occasions and the place was packed both times.\nTheir salad is to die for as is the usual garlic\\/Italian bread.I had shells and meatballs and chicken parm and both were delicious.\nIn my opinion, this is the best Italian restaurant in South Jersey considering the price point and food quality."", ""I don't know what restaurant the bad reviewers dined at because it certainly wasn't Joe Italiano's in Moorestown. This restaurant is outstanding in every way. First, the service we received from Jenn was excellent. She refilled our drinks constantly and was always attentive to our needs. Second, the bread. A warm, fresh loaf of seeded bread and a basket of garlic bread. Both were delicious. Next, the complimentary salad bowl. A nice assortment of lettuce and other veggies in a traditional oil and vinegar. Finally, the entrees. Both were incredible. I had the ravioli and meatballs. The ravioli were oversized and stuffed with ricotta cheese in a wonderful red sauce. The meatballs were large and very tasty. My wife had the homemade spaghetti in three-meat bolognese sauce. It was among the best bolognese we've ever had. My wife, who is Italian, kept saying that this was like eating at her grandmother's on a Sunday night. It is simply impossible to believe that anyone didn't like this place and give it five stars. Maybe they work for other restaurants in the area or maybe they are just chronic curmudgeons. Regardless, this is a much-need and welcome addition to the local dining scene and we'll be back many, many times."", ""First time ever going to a Maplewood restaurant, but I've heard good things about the one in Hammonton. \nThe food was delicious.

She gave us her name with excellent eye contact.  We told her of the reviews we read and asked for menu suggestions.  Morgan gave us suggestions from each menu category. She was attentive throughout our meal and never interrupted us while we ate.   Bread and salad was served before our dinners.  The bread was fresh and warm and was accompanied by sliced garlic bread that was not dripping in butter.  The salad is served family style so you can have more with your dinner.  The salad was fresh, crisp and cold.  The house dressing is excellent.  We both had chicken parm which was high on Morgan's suggestion list.  It was served piping hot on a warm plate.  The chicken was pounded thin to tenderness and cooked perfectly. The spaghetti was a delight.  Fresh, cooked perfectly and not swarming in sauce.  The grated cheese was of high quality with a sharp tang to it.  Noticed that staff were very attentive to children.  Some were served prior to their parents.  The savior of crayons and coloring paper was offered to offset those potential meltdowns.  Very family oriented establishment.\n\nWe will be back sooner than later.

I cancelled my reservation with them, prior to March 13th, however, as I\'m now following up on my refund this hotel has decided that my stay was a ""No Show"" sans any refund and sans anything to encourage me to want to stay with them after already telling me I lost out on $300 for a one night stay. There\'s a global crisis and while Burger King, Allstate and many other companies reach out to provide their clients with discounts or showing some sort of financial empathy, Kimpton would rather take my $300. I guess that sounds about right for selfish corporations, but it\'s certainly not the best approach.', ""I can't speak for the rooms because I'm a local and I've never stayed here but this our new favorite spot for Sunday funday brunch.  The vibe by the pool is chic and fun and the staff is friendly and professional.  We like to sit at the side of the bar facing the pool but there's plenty of comfortable places to kick back if you're looking for something more relaxing.  \n\nMitch has been our server every time and he's awesome. Super accommodating and fun and knows how to make a really good cocktail.  Professional barkeeps are a rare find in this town!!\n\nIf you like pork belly make sure try the Bahn mi or the burger.  The Chillaquilles are the best breakfast item in my opinion, not a huge portion but satisfying nonetheless.  Best Ramen in town but it's only Sunday and make sure you get there relatively early because they only serve a limited number of bowls.   \n\nAll in all the Goodland is a perfect choice for locals looking for a new vibe in town, they'll be seeing a lot more of us!"", ""This was the perfect place for our wedding room block and after party!!

It is the BEST bridal suite...if you're trying to have something super social! It was so so awesome and worked out wonderfully for us!\n- The front desk was so lovely...they always smile and are super accommodating! \n- After Party (ask for Genie): at first, we were reluctant to have it here...but man, there couldn't have been a better place!

So for that price your thinking okay it has to be really nice and worth the money. We'll you get there and the staff isn't very friendly which for any place is always a hit and miss. So we get our room key and we walk in and honestly nothing fancy if anything the quality of the room was very disappointing. Walls are dirty, dresser drawers are nasty and dirty, hair on the bed, pubic hair in the shower, floors are dirty and cheap. I would think for all the money they charge to stay there they can at least do some remodeling. The Parking lot has absolutely no lights other then the lights outside the hotel door. It's dark and uncomfortable to walk around in. Any who we then attend the wedding which was later on disturbed by the front desk trying to get the wedding to end early because of noise complaints. This hotel wants to plan and host weddings then get mad when there's noise. It's a party. If that's not something they wanna deal with they need to only host meetings and tea parties. The amount of money spent by a family member just to host their wedding there to only be bombarded with nonsense.

We were encouraged to have a drink at the bar. However, the bartenders were remarkably slow at filling orders, which for a bloody mary consisted of them pouring the vodka into a glass over ice. You do the rest. When we were seated, we were taken to a room where you could not hear the music being played! So much for jazz brunch. We noticed that most of the people in the room we were seated in were not from New Orleans. This view was confirmed when an older couple and their companion were seated next to us and the manager came by to chat with them. The woman proudly proclaimed that she did not mind sitting with the tourists because the music was too loud for her taste. Our waiter (Remy) was obsequious and made us feel more out of place. Finally, the food, which took a very long time in coming (they delivered food to the wrong table at one point), was good but not great. I had a duck confit hash with eggs. However, the hash turned out to simply be roasted potatoes that are standard at breakfasts. The duck was cooked nicely but the portion size was tiny. My wife was more pleased with her dish of pulled pork over corn bread with eggs.

We had to ask if it was okay if we grabbed a drink at the bar while we waited for our table. Then she also gave us the excuse that the bartender was servicing inside and out, so we'd have to be patient (though we showed no indication of impatience). Ultimately, she made us feel like she was inconveniencing her.  Matter of fact was, she was able to seat us in about 10 minutes, but the whole greeting experience was unusual and not very friendly.  After we were seated and used to restroom, we found half of the restaurant to be empty.  After our meal, I was curious if anyone else had experienced the rude hostess and our experience was very similar to Rudy's below.

I have tried the Norteno taco and Pancita taco. They were both yummy and up to par with the other location. They also offer complementary chips and salsa. Only thing I'm missing is the salsa bar that they have in other location in public market. \n\nWe enjoyed drinks and atmosphere at the Project. Captain Fatty brewery offers wide range of beers and wine. From light beer like mexican lager, beach pilsner to some exotic beers (exotic to me because I'm used to lager and pilsner) like sour beer with cucumber, fruity taste. \n\nThe location is ideal, right in the funk zone where all the actions happen. They have their own parking lot, shared with Loquita next door. The service is great, friendly, and staff are really attentive. I like the open air ambience, with lots of sunlights.

Obviously, if I am crying, then either you are doing something wrong or something is not going right during the procedure. 3 shots later, she was finally done, but the experience wasn't over.

My dish consisted of cold, pre-made scrambled eggs, home fries that tasted stale, toast that was only toasted on one side, and a handful of raw spinach thrown on top. I found it pretty inedible and I swear I'm not normally a picky eater. My sister, who is also not normally picky and loves all things sweet, found that her french toast was tasteless and drowned in a sickly sweet sauce, topped with two pre-scooped balls of ice cream which had refrozen and crystallized. \nTo be fair, we were so shocked at the food we received from this highly-recommended restaurant that we didn't speak to the staff and give them a chance to make it right; we just ate what we could, paid a premium price, and left.

31,"[""Here's why I gave a 5-star rating:\n\n1.) Valet Living is super convenient. Five days a week, I place the trash outside my apartment door, where a rep collects it. No trips to a dirty, smelly dumpster where a large rodent could potentially jump out. \n\n2.) Valet Living keeps the community clean. In communities without Valet trash service, it is common to see broken bags of trash scattered around the property and down the streets surrounding the property. A resident sets their trash on the roof of their car, with the intention of dropping it at the dumpster on their way out. When the resident gets distracted, forgets about the trash on top of their car, and drives off, the trash bag falls to the ground. It then splits open and there is trash everywhere. I've seen the contents of these trash bags scattered a mile or more away from where they originated from. Since trips to the dumpster are much less frequent, there are no trash bags on top of cars, and no unsightly clumps of garbage around the neighborhood. It can take weeks before these clumps are removed. \n\n3.) Valet Living has great customer service. Any issues I've had have been addressed and rectified by the district manager, Jason Casey, efficiently and effectively."", ""Overpriced and inconsistent. They are supposed to come between 8-10pm. However, that rarely happens. Either they come well before 8pm, or they don't come until close to midnight. 3 or 4 times a month, they won't come at all. This is especially frustrating on Thursdays, since they don't come again for another 3 days. Also, $25 a month for a total of 5-6 bags? That's a joke."", ""OMG!

And each and every time I call they are so apologetic, a local district manager will usually call me back and apologize profusely yet they just can't seem to get it right.  \n\nTo add insult to injury my apartment complex has informed my that I will need to start paying $35 a month for this service and they only way to opt out of the service is to move out.

36,"[""I was so disappointed with service we received at this zoo. But the worse thing that happened today Saturday February ,1st. was when my 3 yr. old saw the dinosaur on stage. As he approach the grass area, an employee of the zoo went up to my husband and my child and told them that they had to leave the area. he said this is a private party and you can't be here. My husband asked him, where are the signs posted that we can't be here? sadly, we had to remove my child and he wanted to go back so badly, that we had to leave the zoo. When he realized that we were leaving,  he cried all the way home and we live in Thousand Oaks. No one at the party said anything and they were not even close the party guests. They were on the other side of the lawn. The lawn area, where they have the dinosaur shows is very large. We are so angry, this is bunch of bull, why don't they put a curtain around this area if zoo visitors aren't allowed to watch or approach the grass area? It's pathetic, when children are around and they their excited to see the dino."", ""I've been to many zoos in my lifetime. This one was just sad. You are highly unlikely to get parking at the zoo so you will drive around the little park next door waiting for someone to give up a spot. If you are lucky to park its $11. Once you get in the habitats look unkept. The water is muddy and dirty. The animals look depressed and sickly. The whole experience was saddening. I walked through the whole zoo in under 45 minuted because half the animal enclosures were empty. Not a zoo I would recommend."", 'I am a fan of this zoo!  It was well planned... they made sure that they made the animals cage like their own habitat... its clean and kids will love the different animals that you can see inside.  I will be back!', ""I was taken aghast! Please avoid (I wish I could get a refund). Most of the exhibits were empty either because the animal died or the animal was sick\\/taken to vet or simply empty (nothing to display)\n\nI want everyone to read these 3 points:\n\n1. Elephant, lion and many other major animals died (these are the ones kids love). The so called aviary had only one bird (a duck). No leopards, nothing. There is no mention of these on their website and they charge full price 20$ per adult plus 11$ for parking! Really?\n\n2. Your elephant died (main attraction) and you keep 2 Toyota trucks there for advertisement! We did not pay 20$ per adult to see your Toyota sponsorship.\n\n3. I was in shock to see how the animals were fed\\/treated and how poor\\/pale they felt. You could see it, you could feel it.\n\nThey fed the gorilla twigs branches (without much leaves) to eat. They threw it on top of them. The gorillas didn't bother to eat. They were anemic. (sorry, but they will die as well, it just a matter of time)\n\nI always enjoyed zoos and thought of it as a conservation and rehabilitation center but I left this zoo with a different feeling. If majority of animals died or being taken off to vet something's wrong with your organization.\n\nThis zoo is cruel and merciless. I wish these animals were left in the wild, they will be much more healthy and happy."", ""We went for princess weekend to take my daughter. The zoo was packed. They let every car into their tiny parking lot, we got stuck for 30 minutes just trying to out to the exit away from the crazy crowd. For 17 dollars an adult I was expecting a lot more from this zoo. It seemed like a giant lawn with a few animals here and there. I have been to many zoos and this was the worst zoo I've ever been to. You can't even pet the animals in the petting zoo!! I was disappointed"", ""This is my sons favorite zoo....maybe it's because the first time we went he fed the giraffes or maybe because we took a picture of a bird...the flash startled it and the bird squawked and pooped....no matter we love this zoo.  It is small enough to walk and not be so tired that you cant enjoy a nice meal on the pier nearby.  But large enough to have more than the regular mix of animal species.  We love that it has open space to just sit on the grass or a picnic table and enjoy the beautiful SB weather.  During our most recent trip we noticed construction...which is nice to see because they are expanding\\/updating but did make the flow a little messed up.  If you have little ones the train ride around the park is a nice break to let everyone sit or stop at the deck above the elephants it's shaded and you can watch the elephants play around."", 'I was very disappointed for the first time ever. So many animals off exhibit or being seen by vet. Should have been told this at entrance. No lions, snow leopard, tortoise, gibbons, elephants. Brought my grandsons for their last day in CA. And so dissatisfied. There should be notices up at entrance.', 'My 2-year-old son has a deep fascination for trains... so we drove out here for a day trip from LA to see this small yet intimate zoo.  We fed the giraffes (totally worth the overpriced $6... I wish I could have brought my own 4 small pieces of torn-off lettuce to feed them!), saw the asian otters (my personal fave), watched the snow leopards, and others, to boot.  The animals here look unhealthy. The snow leopard\'s enclosure is right up against the freeway and, as you could hear a big rig truck pass by, one of the leopards was extremely startled and even jumped. Poor thing.  There was only one elephant (animal rights violation, anyone?), and the one gorilla (though supposedly there is a brother... which must have been hiding) would not face the window the entire time, even as he walked down into his little cave carrying his blankie.  If I was one of those caged animals, I\'d be depressed too.  \n\nWe ate at the cafe in the entrance way... the workers here somehow didn\'t understand my question of ""Are there any uncarbonated beverages available with the combo?"" and repeated two times the list of sodas... granted, they looked like high school kids, so maybe that type of language isn\'t ""hipster"" enough for comprehension.\n\nAnyway, I thought perhaps the dinosaur show would possibly offset the sad animals on display... after a few minutes, my son asked if he could walk away.  Sadly, his one other love besides trains is DINOSAURS and he wasn\'t engaged whatsoever.  He told me after we walked away that the dinosaur is ""not fun"".  \n\nLooking for one last attempt to make the trip worthwhile, we walked into the kids playground.  My son played on the sledding hill, until the kid sliding about half a foot from him started screaming and ran to his mother, yelling ""I BROKE MY ARM!!"".  Alas, I got a glimpse of the poor kid\'s wrist- his bone was popping out of his wrist! NO THANKS!  Quickly the rest of the crowd, my son and myself included, gathered our belongings and walked out of the playground, not wanting to meet the same fate.  Um, LAW SUIT, anyone?!\n\nThe only highlight of the trip was riding the train.  The employee running the train gave the riders a simple yet sufficient amount of information of the animals on exhibit around the perimeter of the zoo.  High five for the one win of the day, buddy.', ""I have been to quite a few zoos all over the state and I feel comfortable saying that Santa Barbara's is my absolute favorite!\n\nThis cute zoo is on the smaller side, but I think that's a plus! You don't need to walk long distances to the next animal home and wear out your and your little one's feets. \n\nBut at the same time, it has a lot of open space as well! So much grass and lawn areas to enjoy a picnic with your family (and do bring food and snacks because like all zoos their food is expensive!) There's also a fun play area for the kiddos to run around while you relax. There's also a stage for the fun little shows they put on (we happened across their Dino Doc one today).\n\nA review for this place is not complete without mentioning the famous train ride they've got. It's an extra $5 but it runs around the entire zoo (approximately 15 minutes) while the conductor gives you fun facts about the zoo and the animals. And the kiddos love it!\n\nThey've also got various feeding stations at a few of their animals places, most notably the giraffes. For an additional $6 you will be handed some lettuce and be up close, personal, and probably slimed by these beautiful creatures.\n\n\nEnjoy a fun time here with the fam, the boyfriend, the girlfriend, or the frenemy (if that's what you're into)!"", 'They kept letting private parties cut in line for train.

Finally--we decided to go there for lunch!\n\nUpon arrival, the hostess was friendly and informed us it would be a 15-20 minute wait for an outside table. We were fine with that and followed the COVID-19 instructions to wait outside. There was a very small section with maybe 6 chairs facing the water. We sat down and enjoyed the scenery and within 5 minutes we received a text stating our table was ready. \n\nThe view from the patio dining encompasses the marina and you're able to watch people come in and out on their boats. Additionally, you're able to see all the mansions that border the water. Makes for good conversation! We're pretty sure one of them has an infinity pool with a water slide! \n\nWe're trying to enjoy lighter food these days so we both opted for a salad. I honestly hate ordering salads out but the cobb salad sounded delicious so I went for it. Thank goodness--it was delicious! Their ranch is fabulous! If you know about making ranch dressing, they use buttermilk! So good! You may want to ask for a  second of it-I used 1.5 servings. My husband ordered the Blacken Chicken Alpine salad. He enjoyed it--even saying it was delicious!\n\nMaybe one day we'll venture back for dinner!"", ""All I can say is WOW- we are huge Wolfie's fans and go quite often.

I am SO glad that Wolfie's came to this location on Geist!\n\nI'll start with opening day- the service and the food were incredible, and the place was packed! We ordered a few rounds of drinks and they always came quick. We were never left waiting for our drinks! Ordered BBQ nachos which were delicious, then we ordered 6 entrees and they all came out PERFECT and very quick! Our server was amazing and went above and beyond. She made sure that we had both incredible service and a great time. We stayed for a few hours at a table in the bar and our server never seemed annoyed and we had great conversations with her! \n\nWe have gone several other times since then, the service and the food are always of the best quality. My go-to meal is the Ahi Tacos, they are the absolute best tacos I have ever had in my life- that means a lot coming from a HUGE taco lover. The chips and salsa that come with it are delicious. Perfectly thin and crispy chips, homemade salsa... yum yum!\n\nOne visit in particular was very memorable, our server Reagan was outstanding. You would have NEVER guessed that it was only her second day serving! We had a group of six and she was very attentive, constantly made sure our drinks never went empty and was very knowledgable. After numerous rounds of drinks and lots of food ordered, everything was yet again perfect. \n\nI can not stop raving about this place. I tell all of my friends that they have to go there, and when they do, they fall in love with it too!

We arrived at OB at 11:30am to the hostess telling us that we had no reservations. Secondly, the server just seemed annoyed the entire time and I definitely watched him touch someone's food with his bare hands.

The Pacific Surfliner trains serving this station run ten times daily (five in each direction) between San Diego, California and the Santa Barbara suburb of Goleta, with two of those running in each direction to\\/from San Luis Obispo further to the north. The station is fully staffed with ticketing and checked-baggage services.\n\nThe station was built in 1902 by the Southern Pacific Railroad in the Spanish Mission Revival Style. Design work was by Santa Barbara architect Francis W. Wilson. It is located within walking distance of Santa Barbara Harbor, Stearns Wharf and State Street, Santa Barbara's main thoroughfare.

A gf wanted to go wine tasting for her birthday, so we loaded our bikes and boarded at our nearby station. Of course we didn't wait till we got to SB to get our wine buds in the mood for this escapade. Wine, cheese, crackers and of course, chocolate what was in our packs and were all consumed on the way up. Once we reached SB, we got on our bikes and road around SB tasting all sorts of wine. \n\nThis last time I rode the Amtrak to the Santa Barbara Station was a day spent with The Crew. Crew members boarded from various stations along the way from LA county all the way to Ventura county. Taking up two train cars we mingled and snacked our way to Santa Barbara. \n\nWhen we reached the SB station, our adventure continued, walking down to Mendocino for lunch, then back √πp to the station by way of walking on the beach. Yay!! There was even some rock hopping along the way. \n\nSince the station is so close to the pier, several of us stopped to get ice cream before our ride home. \n\nThis station is in a great location for those wanting to visit SB without having to deal with the traffic on the 101. It's walking distance to the infamous State St., as well as the beach and pier. \n\nTHE TRAIN CARS THEMSELVES:\nClean and comfy \nLots of storage space in the bulkhead, as well as throughout the train\nAbility to walk from car to car\nAble to reserve a whole car for groups\nUnisex toilets on every car (use with caution and good balance)\n\nThere are a couple websites that offer discounts for travel, such as AAA. There is a nominal fee for bikes, but at the end of the day, taking the train over driving can be quite cost effective, especially if you plan to drink."", 'The worst station I have ever been too.  The window attendant Rosa Noriega came from behind the window because she mad I gave the bathroom code to a 6 year old that needed to use the bathroom. This lady verbally used me and assaulted me in front of my 4 year old daughter. She told me it was not my job to open the bathroom for people. The situation got so bad I called the city police and the Amtrak police and filed charges against this woman. I will be escalating this situation and filing complaints. No one and even a child should not have to endure this type of disrespect and abuse from anyone especially someone working at a train st', ""So after a pleasant ride from San Diego,  this disrespectful, racist gentleman refused to give me the code to the bathroom and insisted that I was not a passenger of Amtrak.  Even when I showed my ticket,  he  gave me the wrong code and then disappeared.  His badge says one name but the oddly disturbed man hovering about kept calling him Dominic.  Rude, racist behavior is unacceptable at any time and should not be tolerated.  Unfortunately,  Amtrak wouldn't respond to my chat, email or phone call so I guess this is considered ok. Rest assured I won't let it go.  Has anyone else experienced this kind of treatment at the Amtrak station? Curious if it is directed towards people of color. This guy was hostile and antagonistic to a degree that was unnecessary."", 'IT SHOULD NOT TAKE 4 hours today to get from santa ana to santa barbara!!??\nI ride the train to avoid the traffic!

40,"['I\'d like to dedicate this review to our AMAZING waitress at Nonna\'s, Lydia. She was super professional, attentive and friendly, and really made the visit step up one notch. Big thank you, Lydia! \n\nMy colleague had extreme cravings for meat, whereas I prefer not to have meat, so after a quick yelp search we settled that Little Nonna\'s would have something for the both of us. The restaurant was full when we arrived at around 8pm a Monday, but we were promised a table would be free in 15-20min (just enough time for a quick drink in a bar up the street).\n\nI really loved the look of the restaurant, quaint and cute with a lot of small details to look at. Perfect for a date. \n\nI have to admit that the starters didn\'t blow me away -the mozzarella with charcoal grilled bread was really nice, but would have been better if not so cold. The broccoli dish was ""interesting"", we concluded.\n\nThe main courses though, wow! I had the fish bbq and it was absolutely divine. The recommended wine really added an extra dimension. The veal with sweet potatoes fries was equally praised. We almost didn\'t have room for dessert, but decided to share a hazelnut cannoli. Perfect!\n\nI thiiiink we might have overstayed a bit, as it was completely empty when we left, but none of the staff made any comment or made us feel rushed. \n\nAll of the staff made us feel very welcome and made sure that we had everything we wanted and needed. I would say they are the perfect crew for the restaurant, so the owners better hold on tight to them.', ""It was very bad experience The hostess was racist. Only colored people were made to sit On the back bar. Though 2 and 4 ppl seating was all open all the time. We felt really bad sitting at the table. \n\nFood was not good. The tomato sauce was straight from the can uncooked.  Don't know why ppl like this place."", 'We picked this restaurant based on the stellar recommendation on Yelp. OMG , if you are in the mood for Italian food Do Not Go there. Nonna must have passed away a long time ago and burnt up all of her recipes . \nThe food is a poorly plated mush of ingredients which have little to do with Italian food.', ""Absolutely horrible service.  Booked a table for 2 for a special occasion went there and were made to wait for half an hour on table, I asked if someone can attend us , still no response.  had to leave and get dinner someone else. wouldn't recommend."", ""Had a great meal here.   It's our new favorite place!  Everything was delious and fresh.  We shared the asparagus salad and squid appitazer,  yum. Both ordered the spaghetti and meatballs,  huge portion!  Meatballs were very good but a little salty.  Be aware a glass of wine is $15!  That was a surprise since everything else was so reasonable.  We would definitely go back!"", ""I wish I can give negative stars here. Pretty bad experience. We're there on a Saturday night. So the waiter suggested us for the Sunday gravy. We added another meat ball because there's only one meat ball in the dish. But he didn't put the meatballs on the side, rather he put it inside the dish. (Which makes the overall portion less.) pretty SNEAKY restaurant. The food is way salty, and over priced for a  28 dollar dish that only comes with a side of a pasta and two meat balls with two small pieces of sausages and a super tiny bite of short ribs. DONT EVER GO TO THIS PLACE, totally rip off. There's tons of better of restraints in center city with way decent food and way better price."", 'Had a wonderful meal here, tried to get a table at Barbuzzo and they recommended here! The place is small but pleasant, we had mozzarella with olives to start, I had eggplant part as my meal it was actually an app, but was more than enough, it was deep fried very crispy with pesto and melted mozzarella and marinara, not at all what I expected but delicious. My husband got the lamb shank, it came over lentils which I kept eating off his plate, yum!!! Service friendly and attentive', 'Great experience. Everyone was very friendly and accommodating, waitress was very attentive, and food was delicious. I got the spaghetti & meatballs, and my boyfriend got the rigatoni alla vodka. In addition, we got the garlic bread which was insane. Loved the outdoor courtyard as well.', 'The food enthusiast boo of mine planned a reservation weeks in advance for opening night of Little Nonna\'s.  Unfortunately I reap the yelp rewards, but the previous sentence credits the discovery all to him.  The restaurant is cozy and cute without being overbearingly grandmotherly.  Two tiered wall shelves filled with thrifty flea marketed tea cup towers and blue milk glass surround the dining room, food is served on mismatched china...it\'s like you\'re at Nonna\'s.  \n\nOur order consisted of the shaved salad, meatball appetizer, baked shell entree, and braceola entree (which I pronounced ""brack-ee-ol-ah"" and was immediately corrected by too cool for school boo...it\'s pronounced ""brah-jzoohl"").  By far the best part our meal was the meatballs.  Stuffed with fontina cheese and served with homemade ""gravy"" they were a big and satisfying appetizer.  If you like them so so much, you can get them on top of spaghetti as an entree.  The shaved salad was a perfect accompaniment highlighted with shreds of pecorino.  \n\nI hadn\'t had stuffed shells out at a restaurant before so I was excited to see Marcie\'s take on them.  Her take?  One massive sized stuffed shell served with lamb neck ragu, ricotta, and the freshest mint pesto I\'ve ever had.  The shell came from South Philly so we can\'t hold Marcie responsible for the hard outer edge that sometimes comes from cooking your shells too long.  Aside from some crispy exteriors, we were happy with our order.  The braceola was more sausage like than we expected and served with a salty delicious broccoli rabe.  We were pretty full by the time we dug into that and I ate the rest for lunch the following day.\n\nFor desert we were adventurous and ordered the tomato water ice served with basil ice cream.  It was fun to eat, but it\'s not that sweet (hey I rhymed!).  It tastes like tomatoes as the name might hint, but when combined with the basil cream it\'s ridiculous.  I felt like I was tasting the smell of when I stick my face into my tomato plant on my deck.  Because I do this.  Because it smells so freaking good.\n\nI want to go back and try the Caesar salad and the Vongole, which scared me at first because it\'s served with open full cherry stone clams - but in fact they are not that large.  Little Nonna\'s is a great take on Italian and makes good traditional date with little opportunities to take food risks.  Plus the outdoor seating is romantically lit and private.  Check it out!', ""Seriously. WOW.\n\nEven for restaurant week, this place impressed two picky broads.\n\nI like the Turney\\/Saffrran empire. Lolita was great. Jamonera is totally tasty. I might like Barbuzzo the least (except the budino, which is heavenly.) So I figured I'd enjoy their newest spot.\n\nLet me start by saying prettiest garden in the city. And huge. \n\nMenu is a series of items that are all appealing, and from what I ate, all are phenomenal.\n\nFor resto week, you get garlic bread, white bean dip, roasted garlic, and olives. I was almost full from gorging myself on delicious dip and crusty yet soft bread by the time by appp got there. Which were risotto balls in truffled something. Truffled anything is excellent. My entree sounded good but run of the mill, but the lemony chicken smooshed with a brick (my interpretation) had tangy and sweet and complex flavors was super rich and somehow light, and accompanied by fried potato loveliness and artichokes I couldn't get enough of. Tiramisu was good, I think, but I was so full, it was hard to tell.\n\nThe service was friendly, though a bit slow, which is probably par for the course given that they just opened and it was packed. \n\nInside was dark and romantic and tiny. I imagine it gets loud up in there but when you're eating so well, who cares?""]",6
41,"[""There were 4 us for lunch.  I ordered what turned out to be 5 HUGE chunks of fatty pork which I sent back for a sandwich. Grouper was not cooked.  The tuna was gray & I wouldn't taste it.  Skirt steak dish w\\/ cold & hard tostones was not worth $10.  Fortunately, the pork was taken off the bill.  All we had were sodas.  $100 total.  We ordered from the dinner menu. The server was impeccable.  The presentations were pretty bad.  We wished it was better.  Maybe Puerto Rican cuisine isn't for me."", 'Horrible Service.  The Food was barely Tolerable. My overall experience with the waiter has just horrendous.  Not going back.', 'We arrived for dinner not knowing what to expect on any level. I was somewhat excited, as I have an affinity for Puerto Rican food. The beer list only features Corona and three heavier American domestic beers, which was a huge surprise and disappointment. Everything went downhill from that point forward. Our corn fritter appetizers arrived still frozen in the center. We sent them back. The second round of corn fritters arrived still frozen in the center. Back they went, and the staff seemed surprised at our displeasure.  Given the price point of the meal, I was shocked that Pernil (pork dish) arrived as a few cubs of slow roasted pork a la carte with four pieces of plantain as the supplement. The standard rice and beans that usually accompany a dish like this was absent, creating an underwhelming and stark presentation. Not to mention a meager portion for and $18. My companion had the chicken soup, which was fine, but salty, however, the mofongo con yucca ordered as supplement arrived still icy in the middle. That was the third frozen offense of the evening. Our bill was nearly $60 for what we concluded was the least pleasant and most disappointing dining experience we have had in Nashville. No serious attempt at service recovery, a price point not aligned with the quality of product (grotesquely overpriced), same preparation error repeated multiple times across different dishes, and an indifferent staff. We tend to be low-maintenance customers, so we just noted the awful experience and pledged to never return. Realizing we could have a much more substantive meal both in terms of quality and value proved bothersome for the next day or so.  Give Salsa a wide berth. Nashville can do better.', ""Food was very fresh and flavorful! Loved the rotisserie chicken and the beef empanadas which were recommended were delicious. Food took a little long to come to table and it was slow inside but worth the wait if making fresh. We asked to be seated outside on the patio even though it wasn't set up for seating due to cooler weather lately and without hesitation they made us very comfortable for our needs. This little spot is in a great location I hope to try out the Salsa scene on Tuesday nights! I suggested adding some patio lights to draw attention and make more festive. Go visit them!"", ""Terrible service.\n\nI've come here about 15 times and ordered drinks, and I've been frustrated with the service almost every time. The only reason I come here is for the salsa dancing, otherwise I would have never returned. \n\nThe problem is that it takes them forever to get your drink, even if you're the only person at the whole bar. They just don't care. First, when you go to the bar to order something, they ignore you. Once you order a drink, they just stand around staring for a couple of minutes. Last night I ordered a vodka and pineapple, and I waited about 7 minutes for her to start on my drink. They were busy last night, but there were three bartenders, and they were all moving slowly or just standing around. Before she started on my drink, she took orders from several other people and took care of some bar chores that didn't seem crucial. I tried to get the attention of one of the other bartenders. I told her about the situation and she did not acknowledge that there was a problem or anything.\n\nI will say that I have had the coquitos twice, and it was pretty good. It was really good the first time, but too sweet the second."", 'DO NOT GO with large group.

Every once in a while, we would go to Chevy's, hopeful that it would not be terrible, and just end up depressed.  Back to La Casa Mexicana: the ambience is great.  The entire restaurant is very well decorated, the Latin music is audible but not overpowering, and lighting is comfortable.  \n\nFood-wise, the first thing, which is normally make or break for me, is the chips and salsa.  Here the chips were yellow corn tortilla chips, a little thicker than average, not greasy, and very good. The salsa is medium-spicy roasted tomato salsa.  It was as good or better than any I have tried north of the Red River.  I asked for spicier salsa and they brought some out.  It seemed like an Arbol chile salsa and was definitely hotter, but not ridiculously hot.  I ordered the lunch combination #5 (quesadilla, chalupa, and beef enchilada) and my wife ordered the huevos Mexicanos.  The flour tortillas that came with the huevos and the quesadilla were made in house.  They were soft, warm, and fresh.  The cheese in the quesadilla was real cheese, not cheese sauce.  The chalupa was a tostada shell covered with refired beans, guacamole, lettuce and cheese.  It tasted great, but I had to eat it with a fork and knife as it was soggy by the time I got to it.  The beef enchilada was the best--thick corn tortilla, good quality beef that was seasoned just right, and sauce that really hit the spot.\n\nThe service was ok.

The next round took another 20 minutes to come out, and then the food came following. It took over an hour to get our food. I ordered a burger, which wasn\'t even warm. My friend\'s side of asparagus was flat it cold, and my girlfriends side salad was disgusting. Our other friends were all relatively unimpressed with their food. We realize we were at ballpark village, but I have eaten better food at a little league ballpark. \n\nOn top of this, it took us reminding our waiter several times what we ordered for drinks for him to finally procure them. Like 4-5 reminders. \n\nWhen our food came we ordered some more drinks, which all came out at different times. One of my friends waited 45 minutes for his beer which never came and by that time we were closing out so he said to not bother getting it. \n\nWe were all prepared to just split up the check on our own because we couldn\'t fathom our waiter having the ability to split the check seeing as he couldn\'t even get a draft beer in a 45 minute span, but he surprised us and asked how we\'d like to split the check. It came as little surprise when he split everything up entirely wrong, and at this point we wanted to get out of there as fast as possible so we paid and worked out the inaccuracies on our own. \n\nHe then charged the wrong totals on the wrong cards, and actually left the biggest tab uncharged with the card still sitting in his pocket. \n\nBetween the pathetic food quality and far and away hands down the worst service start to finish we have ever received, I would rate this dump -100 stars if possible. Stay far away. Ballpark village needs to step up their restaurants to match the quality of the giant projector they have inside. \n\nOur experience was the worst I have ever received paying for any service anywhere in my entire life, and the word incompetent doesn\'t even start to scratch the surface to accurately portray our waiter.', 'Horrible customer service! Made reservations 1 week in advance for 12 people. Only to get there & find out they didn\'t have our reservation. We tried showing the printed email to the manager. She was very very unprofessional and refused to look at it. Only to say they do not take reservations. Hmmm...I\'m pretty sure the website says you do. Finally, 1 hour later....got a table. The food wasn\'t as good as it should have been and once AGAIN the customer service was very disrespectful and rude. I will never go back or for that matter recommend The Brew House in ball park village to anyone!\n\nJust got an email from the GM at The Brew House, Ben Brengle, asking if he could help in any way since he reviewed my post on yelp. Sorry, Mr. Bengle...you were the biggest problem last night. Like I said YOU are unprofessional. The only way to help me is to help yourself find a new job. I\'m thinking customer service isn\'t for you. Considering you manage that unprofessional staff and I can understand why they are that way...you are the most egotestic person, who thinks they can speak to people insuch an awful unprofessional way. You are a manager of a family restaurant I don\'t think dropping the ""F"" bomb at customets is very polite at dinner time. \n\nI just think people need to realize not to waste their time or money here.

However, I am the type that can drop transgressions easily and move on so by the time I take the 4 block trek home, I\'m over it enough to not log onto Yelp.\n\nHowever, today was the last straw. \n\nThe overall reason for a one star review is the total lack of customer service in any capacity whatsoever. I have never once had an experience there related to customer\\/employee interaction that has EVER been more than a two at most. I\'m going to go ahead and share all of these experiences. Maybe (but probably not) someone at Mugshots will care this time. \n\nToday: Brought all my school work and computers down to Mugshots to work on school work. There Wi-fi is accessible for 60 minutes only with purchase and with a code provided by the cashier (I am not even complaining about this fact but still, come one guys, free wi-fi is a little give for a lot of get in the coffee shop world. Your image could use a boost.). I also ordered an egg, tomato, guacamole, and cheese sandwich and an americano. Americano was fine. Sandwich was made with obviously old guac...it was brown, cold, and flavorless as avocados tend to become when refrigerated for too long. I was contemplating asking for a different sandwich but then I thought better of it because I would just be met with blank stares and don\'t care attitudes (those things are extremely commonplace with the staff). The first code I received for wi-fi access came up with ""promotional access denied."" So I asked for assistance, was given another code, and that one did not work either. When I went back to the counter and said that it didn\'t work either the guy said he didn\'t know. He asked two of his co-workers about it and they said ""Last time it happened, we had to call the company."" Then the three of them kinda stood there with blank stares (like I said, a common response). Then the guy said ""Well, how do I do that."" One girl shrugged her shoulders and the other said ""Oh, I don\'t know I don\'t go into the office."" More blank stares then the guy said to me, ""Sorry, I don\'t know what to do."" What?! You DO know what to do, dude. Call the company and fix the problem. Obviously this has happened before as your co-workers pointed out and obviously the solution is to call the provider. However, none of them wanted to do it so I was told ""Too bad."" Really, Mugshots? You know how to solve a problem but you don\'t do it because...you\'re lazy? You don\'t want to? It\'s not ""your"" job? What is it? This is a common theme throughout all of my negative experiences here. Disconnected, disinterested, too-cool-for-school employees who can\'t be bothered with simple customer service. \n\nA summary of other complaints:\n\n1. A few weeks ago I ordered an Americano. There were three people at the registers and one person in the kitchen area. I waited 18 minutes (I timed it on my phone) before I said anything. I said ""excuse me, is someone going to make my drink?"" Yes, I said it with a little bit of an attitude. The girl stared at me (blank stares!) then said, ""Yea, give me am minute"" and went back to the registers where two other people were (there are only two registers so...) Two minutes later she went to the espresso machine clearly annoyed and sloppily made my drink. It was filled all the way to the top making it difficult to carry to the condiment stand. I felt it was done on purpose. My evidence: the smirk and ""here you go"" delivered with an attitude when she handed me the drink.\n\n2. Last Saturday morning (an insanely busy time at Mugshots) I was waiting in line along with 16 other customers (I counted because I wanted to write a Yelp review and be accurate) for my morning coffee. Some man walks in the door, cuts to an open register before the woman waiting in line gets to it. The woman seemed confused and said she was too embarrassed to say anything so I leaned over and said to the cashier, ""That man just cut in front of everyone."" The cashier look flustered, said ""oh, I just got here"" and continued to help the man instead of asking him to wait in line. Yea, no. \n\n3. The food and drink are over-priced for the quality of customer service. I understand that Mugshots supports local and sustainable farms and I truly appreciate that and understand that that means higher prices. I wouldn\'t have a problem paying them if I was treated like the PAYING customer that I am.\n\n\nSo, the reason why I keep going here is two-fold. One, I live 4 blocks away and I will put up with a lot for convenience and non-Starbucks coffee. Two, I\'m somehow convinced it will get better. I, for some reason, believe management will catch on to the arrogant, disrespectful ignorant way it\'s staff operates and make changes.

I was slightly thrown off but didn\'t want to make it an issue so agreed to another round. \n\nBut as I sat and processed what had just occurred. It grew glaringly apparent that the table next to me now on their third bottle of wine, was not facing the same challenges that I was in obtaining this coveted wine list. This led me to wonder what about me made it unattainable? Noticing the demographic of the table next to me and the majority of the restaurant (over 50 and white), I couldn\'t help but wonder, was it my age, the fact that we had a 7 month old in our party or was it my race? Adding insult to injury, it was at this very moment, the table next to us where 3 Caucasian couples who were moments ago talking about a new villa in their 55+ community, were deep in conversation with their server about a red wine that they were really enjoying. At this point in the meal I was no longer interested in the food or being there, we hurriedly finish our pizza and drinks and left to go to another establishment for dessert. \n\nI write this not to accuse the waiter of any act of malice, I truly believe he thought he was looking out for us. But I can\'t help but feel that something about our appearance said, ""this family cant handle what\'s on our wine list."" And this, to me, is unacceptable. I hope that management reads this and evaluates their staff\'s practices so that another individual or family, never has to leave their establishment feeling belittled, even if it was unintended.\xa0 Have travelled throughout the US, Europe, the Caribbean and Latin American and never once been denied a reasonable basic request, it is sad that as a Floridian, we had to experience this in St. Pete, FL. \n\nAs a professional couple in our early 30s with two young children, our schedules don\'t often allow for us to have many sit down dinners. So it is regretful that instead of spending the remainder of the evening with full stomachs and pleasant memories, we have heavy hearts and deeply regret visiting your establishment. I truly hope that this is addressed so no one else is left with this take away.', 'End of a stressful day I\'m looking for a place with a great bartender and delicious meal ... walking along 2nd Ave there are a lot of places, but they\'re a bit more of a \'scene\' then the refined dinning I\'m looking for.  \nAs I approach Gratzzi Italian Grille, I see the tables out front are full and the aroma is delicious.

Normally bagna cauda made with olive oil and I assumed that it was.

I think restaurant has obligation to disclose ingredients when serving  1\\/2 a cup of butter to unsuspecting client. 2 badly prepared scallops floating in butter were served with no vegetables, I don't consider slice of radish a vegetable. While lunch was $20, very little food was served. I understand that it is hard for restaurant to do it for $20, but I think restaurant should present sample of their food during restaurant week and not make money of diners.  Also bread was not served with lunch, while olive oil (quite good quality) bottle placed on every table.  As I was leaving hostess asked me how lunch was and I told her about my experience. Normally I would expect restaurant to make some kind of accommodation especially after she saw me buying quite few products at their  deli\\/bakery. I received no  accommodation.

We had a party of 6, and the two other couples wanted to order oil containing animal products in it. We asked if they could make an exception (even though they say only 2 pots per 6 people) since we are vegan and do not eat animal products. They said no, so one of the couples had to go without their option and share with the other non-vegan couple.\n\nThe veggie plate they gave us cost $19 each for a small salad plate's worth of veggies\\/tofu (it was literally about $1.20 worth of food on the plate). It was such a small amount of food that it was absolutely ridiculous. A couple small pieces of asparagus, three small pieces of artichoke, four pieces of tofu, two mushrooms cut into halves to make four tiny mushroom pieces. We thought we would be given a big plate of veggies, since they cost virtually nothing (as vegans, we know the price of veggies, we're experts in fact, because that's the bulk of what we eat!). I literally could have bought nearly 20x the amount of food for what they charged us. It was pathetic. We asked if there was more, and they said no.\n\nFurthermore, none of the chocolate options were made without milk - not even the dark chocolate, which was strange. High quality dark chocolate is by chance vegan, because it isn't made with milk.\n\nWe were starving when we left, and it took forever to get out of there. We went home and made curry because we felt like we had eaten nothing at all. This place is great if you're happy to eat every course containing animal products, but if you're not, then there is no point in you going.

GREAT COMPANY POLICY! (Insert sarcasm here.)\n\nI would never go back.  Complete rip-off, actually highway robbery for the measly few veggies we got. Nice to know that plant-based eaters aren't given any consideration at this restaurant. We eat out a lot and are happy to pay above-average prices for great quality food. But we felt like we were just a burden at this place and it was brutal what they gave us.\n\nTip for the future, Melting Pot: Take into consideration your vegan customers - we're a big market, we like to spend money, and now you've lost valuable customers.

61,"[""The Perfect Wedding Cake!\n\nI have lived in Wayne for 17 years and have dreamed if I ever get married, I'd order my wedding cake from this bakery.  I have eaten many of their cakes, and pastries over the years and all of them are worth every bite and calories when one wants to splurge.\n \nMy husband and I chose the decadent Chambord Cake, it was beyond delicious and beautiful. The light and airy hazelnut sponge cake surely compliments the chocolate cake with chocolate mousse and raspberry filling and fresh raspberries along with my husband's favorite of white chocolate mousse.  My guests at my wedding reception couldn't stop raving about the elegant, moist, delicious cake.   One of the guests cornered my mother and questioned her as to where this bakery is located in Wayne.  She was giving directions during the wedding reception.  \n\nNina and Patrick your cakes are exquisite and you were able to make my dreams come true!"", 'The absolute best. It is a beacon of Wayne and adored by all those who live here. Anyone who says otherwise is an absolute uncultured swine.', 'Just ordered a chocolate birthday cake--- wow!  Service was perfect; will return!!', 'We were looking for a non-traditional wedding cake and found the perfect thing at Aux Petits Delices! Instead of the typical sponge cake, Nina was able to give us an Opera cake and a lemon creme cake that were both incredibly delicious, and unlike any wedding cake we have ever tasted! She accommodated us and both sets of parents in the little shop to plan out the style and colors, and was charming even while bombarded with our millions of ideas. We has a perfect cake that looked amazing and tasted even better!', ""Very disappointed today when I arrived to pick up my pre-paid order.\nThey could not locate my order and after 15 minutes I decided to have my credit card credited and left.\nAfter many years of patronizing the best French Bakery today's experience did me in.  Thank you Patrick for many years of consistently excellent pastries and good luck to the new owner."", '*EDITED SINCE OWNER REPLY*\n\nThe owner replied below to my review, and I think that it only strengthens my comments. My dear, you are snarky and rude, and do not deserve attention. Yet here I am. Yes, you won best croissant this year - out of only a handful of entries. Last year you did not, out of 5. So please, do not make an accolade out of a participation award when the pool isn\'t that big to begin with. In other reviews on social media you state that you want to make the bakery your own and not the owners recipes. Convenient you blame the macarons on him. And yes, I did buy something, I tried the opera. It is supposed to be a sponge cake soaked in coffee syrup and instead it was dry and crumbly. And, in regards to your snarky comment about a song and dance a simple ""thank you"" once I\'ve completed my purchase is hardly a dance. It\'s called customer service, which you clearly do not understand. Song and dance?! Who even talks like that when I asked for ""pleasantries""? A ""hi how are you"" or ""hi can I help you"" would be just lovely. Instead, nothing OH and she walked to the back before I even turned to leave the shop. Other people may think some of your baking is great, and that\'s just wonderful for them. My opinion is of your poor customer service, your terrible attitude, your dry food, and flat macarons. \n______\nI want to love this place but I just can\'t. We went in today and the woman behind the counter hardly greeted us, or exchanged pleasantries. I wanted macarons, and they had three flavors available. Macarons are supposed to have feet on the wafer, about the size of a half dollar, and not flat. These were the opposite. Flat, oddly misshapen, and you couldn\'t even see whatever filling was inside. It looked as if a novice made these, and I have made better in my own kitchen. I know everyone can be a critic and I have read the owners replies to other negative reviews. If you\'re making French pastries, you better get it right. Don\'t put out passable exuse', 'I am a very regular customer. Today I asked my assistant to purchase 40 macaroons for an event. It turned out all these macaroons were very old (crusty\\/hard\\/tasteless). You should not treat customers this way. When your products get too old, just dump them. Or we will dump you.', 'Had the worst birthday cake I have ever had and sort of like pizza, never really thought there could be a ""bad"" piece of cake. So disappointed regardless of price but it also happened to be more expensive than others in the area. More than happy to pay for good product but all at the table sadly agreed it should go right into the garbage. Terrible.', ""If you asked me a week ago, I would have given 5 stars because of how kind the owner was when I spoke to her after hours regarding my wedding cake for 5\\/3\\/19 and emailed back and forth photos. (I originally met with a woman who no longer works there, so it gave me piece of mind to review my plans with the owner who said she had the notes from me original meeting.)\n\nHowever, as of today, I would give them 0 stars if I could. Somehow they forgot about my wedding that I originally booked them for in September. They sent. A display cake to the wedding. Somehow managed to put together something that was not at all my cake design (the only common factor was the color of the middle tier) and deliver it last minute. My venue and bridesmaids did a great job of distracting me so I wouldn't worry about the cake issue, but it was very disappointing when I walked into the reception and saw a cake that wasn't mine. \n\nThe owner assured me I had nothing to worry about when we spoke, she empathized saying that she was also getting married and knew how stressful it is. I sent her pictures of everything, described it in detail when we spoke, and left detailed notes at my tasting. To just forget about a wedding is a disgrace.\n\nUpdating just to add that I never ONCE was contacted by the owner or offered an apology for forgetting my WEDDING CAKE. I reached out on my own multiple times to speak with someone about it and never heard anything back. Was at least hoping they would take some ownership."", 'Absolutely Delicious pastries- everything from the croissants, petit fours to the napoleons and cakes!! Wonderful, friendly staff too!!']",5
62,"['This place is the worst dealership I have ever done business with! I have been buying cars for over 30 years and never have I come across a sales team with such a lack of integrity and double talk. Run, don\'t walk away from them!\nI spoke to them over the phone about a new Jeep Wrangler and went back and forth about what documents are needed. I sent them all required docs, my license, registration and current insurance info. I then mentioned that I may have a car to trade so we set up an appraisal on that for today 11\\/19 at 3 pm. I also told then I may not do the trade and this has NO bearing on my decision to buy the vehicle. I then sent them everything that they asked for along with my credit card and told them ""I want the vehicle, please use this credit card for a deposit"" I can pick it up or have it shipped next Saturday. I was told once I filled out the credit application on line I would get a firm interest rate and a new quote from a fast talker named SID.  I gave them my personal information my SS # and a credit card. I heard nothing back until a day later I get a call from SID telling my he is ""following up"" from my call yesterday and goes on to tell me they SOLD the vehicle today. This is after I filled out the credit app sent my CC and said I want it! Take the deposit from my card.\nI gave them everything in good faith, and I got typical ""used car salesman"" double talk\\/BS. SID tried to tell me we had no deal he was off and didn\'t see my response and my CC. How unprofessional is that? He tried to say we had no deal because we had no appraisal on my current car, what a joke this guy is! I clearly said I may not do the trade and I want the car. What else do they want? Their lack of follow up and unprofessional approach should deter anyone in the car market from dealing with these clowns.', ""0 STARS IF POSSIBLE!\n\nI bought a 2009 Edge a little over a year ago. I arrived at the dealership around 7pm and didn't get to leave until after midnight! I traded in 2 cars for it, one of which was from my recently deceased aunt. I was promised specific amounts for each car. I was so tired, i just wanted to sign the contract and go finally go home!\n\nThere were a few parts on the car that were broken when I bought the car -  they fixed them for free, which would have been nice if they didn't keep me sitting there all day! It took them 3 hours to install a windshield washer jet, an installation that should only take 30 seconds! They told me they ordered the part when I made my appointment. The first hour of sitting there was bearable, until they told me they sold my part. It took an additional hour for my replacement part to arrive. After the third obnoxious hour I was finally on my way home! An oil change even takes a couple hours. If you plan on getting service done there, you'll need to take the whole day off work! - that's not even all my bad experiences with them.\n\nRecently I have been going through the receipts for my purchase to give them to the lawyer of my aunts estate. I noticed that the trade-in values of the cars I traded in were not correct, in fact - they were off by $1000! they didn't even have the amounts for each car on the receipt, they lumped them both together. I had to contact them to get me an official document stating the amount for my aunts car. I had been calling them for almost a MONTH before I spoke to someone! I was either given a voicemail or a promise of a call back - which never happened! When I FINALLY got someone to talk to they couldn't give me an answer as to why they didn't give me the promised amounts - because none of the same people work there! They emailed me a copy of the receipt - which took an additional day because they had to get it from their Philadelphia store, where I didn't buy the car! Upon looking at the receipt they emailed me, IT'S NOT EVEN SIGNED! It's not signed by me, or the store manager! This is not only annoying to deal with, but it has caused a huge legal estate issue!\n\nI strongly feel as though Chapman has disrespected me and my family! I feel like I was taken advantage of because of how young I am and the fact that am a woman - put them together and apparently you have a mix that is perfect to rip off.\n\nI cannot stress enough to anyone; DO NOT TAKE YOUR BUSINESS TO CHAPMAN!\nSomeone else will take much better care of you, your family, and your wallet."", ""The service center is allergic to doing work. I've been to this Ford a handful of time for body shop work, but whenever I had a service related question I was confronted with really bad attitudes, like I was was asking the most inconvenient questions.\n\nI just left this place feeling like I needed a law degree to convince these guys to look at my car. Never coming to this dealership again. The service center sucks."", 'Where to began. I have a 2019 RAM 1500 Longhorn. I noticed the back window was leaking and I had a bubble in my leather dash. I setup an appointment and dropped the truck off. They ordered the parts needed for the repair and contacted safelight to come out to install in the window. I retrieved the truck and waited for the parts to come in. Fast forward a few weeks I dropped the truck off and picked up my rental. The guy who helped me is no longer employed by Chapman ( which is a good thing). They held onto my truck for almost 3 weeks. I picked the truck up and noticed they didn\'t even give it a courtesy wash. The truck was beyond filthy. I ran it down the street to the car wash and guess what, the window still leaked. I also observed the water stain that they did not address. I get the truck home and started looking harder and noticed the rear window was chipped during install. I made yet another appointment this time the lady who handled the claim was A LOT better in every way. The truck was now in the shop for another week. I explained since they removed the dash I have been having issues with my USB plugs. They told me they couldn\'t find the problem ( now every time I hit a bump it loses connectivity). The installed the window and replaced my third brake light (my $30 LED bulbs that were in the brake light took a walk during this process). I get the truck back filthy again but no water stain, no leaks, and no chips. Fast forward to today. I noticed a rattle coming from the back seat area. After closer examination the ""mechanic"" who removed the rear seats together the window out did not tighten the bolts down for my rear seatbelts. They also failed to properly put pieces back together. Obviously their techs don\'t have a clue as to what they are doing so I will be addressing the seat area and USB connection issue myself. If I cannot resolve the issues I will take the truck to Fred Beans since they seem more on the ball.

68,"[""My husband and I read the reviews before going here for an early evening dinner. \n\nRule #1: if you see a bad review, look and see what else the person has reviewed. Anyone who gives Barrel 55 one star and Noodles and Company, Olive Garden, and McDonald's five stars....well, just sayin. Pocatello, Idaho is a culinary wasteland, so what does someone from there know anyhow? \n\nAnd then there are the folks that give EVERY review a one star. Stay home and cook your own food, I say. You can have your frozen dinner as you sit on your widening hips in front of the TV. Have as much soda and salt as you want. You will never be happy. \n\nThat being said, we really enjoyed Barrel 55. The beer selection is outstanding. That is important. If your beer menu consists of Bud Light and 754 IPAs...then you have lost me. But this beer selection was great, a balance of several German beers, ambers, porters, some sours, and many offerings from local and regional brewers.\n \nI had the salmon: Nice presentation of sockeye (might have been chinook) on a smoky plank with some roasted veg. The seasoning and sauce was excellent. \n\nMy husband had the burger because...well he always gets a burger. He is the expert burger guy in Boise, though I wish he would splash out and get something more exciting. A burger does, in fact, help to bring out the best in a beer. It looked great, on a nice bun. \n\nI tried the fries when my hubby wasn't looking and they were very good as well.\n\nThe waiter was all about himself, telling us that it is his birthday and practically reading his resume to us. Ok. Just bring me my food and go away please. But I figure that bad waitstaff soon exits through the back door. The guy didn't make my food taste good. The chef did. Can't make a living by acting like an idiot waiter. We didn't do much in the way of tip, as not to encourage his bad behavior."", 'I had the weirdest experience at this place. First, the waitress was one of those sugary overly pushy types who kept calling me ""honey"" and ""sweety"" and checking on us every two or three minutes (but not bringing our food, the straw we asked for or doing anything to provide service).  I ordered a huckleberry vodka cocktail from their menu. She brought me something in a mule cup with ginger beer. I mentioned that it wasn\'t what I ordered but that it was fine - mostly because I wanted her to leave us alone so we could eat. She argued with me that it was in fact the item I ordered. I explained that I thought it was a different menu item but again said it was fine. She came back five minutes later to tell me that she had confirmed with the bartender that the drink was in fact the vodka one I ordered. I again explained that it had ginger beer in it and no vodka.  I am not exaggerating when I say we had three separate conversations about the drink.  I left wishing I had just kept my mouth shut because it ruined the whole meal. The food was fine - we had fish and chips which were not bad - but based on this experience we won\'t be back.', 'We used to come here once a month and get the New York strip steak... which was amazing! Delicious veggies and potatoes. Loved the artichoke appetizer! Unfortunately, we were informed that there is a new chef. They took the artichoke off the menu...our $30 ""medium"" New York strip tasted cheap and chewy and was well done... nothing like before. They added a glaze that was not good. To be fair they offered to remake the steak but after waiting for 20-30minutes and having them forget our salad, bread and very late refills we declined. We also came in after 8 and were basically ignored by staff as they were just chatting with each other- which I don\'t mind if I still get refills! We are so sad! Loved this place!

No wine  or beer list on the table - had to ask for it (people got up and went to the bar to obtain a beverage), wrong and incorrect orders(no clue who ordered what and if correct , it had been served to the wrong person), warm Chardonnay, out of food, under cooked food, others in the group already finished eating before others ever received their food. Seriously, everyone was done eating before my husband received his dinner (except me).  My burger was ""bloody"". I clarified that I wished for my burger to be well done. I was informed that all burgers are done well unless otherwise requested.  I was the last one to receive my meal. So much for our annual  birthday dinner gathering.  I think this is the first time I have never left a tip (and we always tip and tip well). I will go again.... but only for a beverage. Never again for dinner!! Very disappointing!  To top it off, on the way out our server stated ""thanks for getting me fired tonight""! Really!  We were there to have a great time with friends, eat and drink.

If you have footage of me walking out of your restaurant having not paid my tab, wouldn't you share that with authorities to ensure I did pay?

She returned and said that it has been taken care of by the manager.\n\nIn the end, I received a check and was shocked that the manager removed the fish but charged me 9.00 for the wilted greens.\n\nBottom Line: Service was a disgrace...when I told the manager that I was not paying 9.00 for wilted greens especially after I was served burnt fish, he said to me that he and his staff tasted my fish and that it was not burnt and since I was refusing to pay for the wilted greens, he was going to call the police...he then had the audacity to ask me what I do for a living.

Good red wine vinegar flavor.  \nI had the penne pasta with shrimp, clams, scallops and I substituted the sauce for the pesto saute with light cream.  DAMN it was good.  Shrimp was standard...a bit over cooked but fine tasting and a bit tough.  The clams were really good but only had a few.  Definitely from the Pacific, they didn\'t pack a punch when you bit into them (if you\'re from New England you\'ll have to pass on these).  The scallops were not scallops in my opinion  My best example, a thick lima bean.  i almost said there were no scallops then I saw one wedged in a piece of penne and thought ""no shit, that explains $18.

The sauce was oyster mushrooms and some cream...too rich for me but so is filet mignon.  I also need a bit more bite in my mushroom so the oysters wouldn\'t be my choice.  It was served with a steamed chard which is not my choice either.  More support for why the pasta was damn good.  The bread was ciabatta leaning on the sour side so I was way into.  \nOur server liked everything, recommended it all and had trouble picking a favorite...AHHH don\'t believe you!

She grunted, said something about it being broken, left and did something- it turned back on. she didn't say a word but pointed to the 'on' light with disgust. \nThere was also only one person working the omelette\\/Eggs Benedict area, at Mother's Day brunch, and the line was quite long.

Next, the only meat that came through to our area was the same sausage, over and over again. The only other thing that finally came our way was salmon. So my brunch consisted of a piece of salmon and scrambled eggs on an English muffin. After that, I looked for our waiter to ask for some coffee. Finally someone else saw me looking around, and I asked him. 15 minutes later, my coffee arrives, with no cream or sugar. 10 minutes later I get sugar, 5 minutes after that, cream.

I was helped as soon as I walked in with a really knowledgeable sales person.  He worked with us one-on-one for about a half an hour scouring the entire floor and warehouse to make sure we got the exact product that we were looking for.  After that we sat down and did the paperwork, it was pretty painless compared to lots of other purchases I have had to make.  They gave us a date to pickup (which I chose), and I went on my way.  HOWEVER, this is when I really became pleased with the customer service.   I'm not sure how it happened but after I picked up the marble (that they helped me load) I realized that there was a size mistake that I had made.  Their head of sales moved mountains to help me get the right product for this job and to clean up my mess.  I will be doing all my future counters and floors with them for sure."", ""Do not believe ALL the reviews.  Our sales person (s) were nice and cared about what we were doing.  They have great value priced slabs and really nice upscale higher level slabs.  We shopped all the local co's and found their value to be the best.  If you need old counters removed, plumbing removed, etc, it will cost more, sometimes much more due to complexity and liability.  We had brand new cabinets waiting and the price was a quoted.  We were able to only have  1 seam and you cannot find it.  Everyone who sees our kitchen loves our tops.  We paid just over 2k and the guys with all the billboards on 95south had the same slab at a higher level and quoted 4k.  So be very careful when looking for an insane deal.   The installers were VERY proffesional.  He showed me what the plan was and they took their time to execute it.

Sales experience was kinda weird because when you go in to pick out your granite a sales person follows you everywhere so those little debates you have with your significant other are hard to have and awkward because a sales person is right next to you the whole time but I understand because they have to make sure nobody is crushed by giant slabs of granite. \n\nHad a bit of a problem at installation time. They measured wrong the first time and the counter was off and crooked. Installer came back a few days later to check it out and was pretty much beating around the bush and trying to make it seem like it was my fault for some reason and even at some point said that when they were initially installed a few days ago I signed off on the paperwork so its my problem at this point. Needless to say I was pissed and was about to write a terrible review. \n\nCalled colonial the next day and without even questioning my case they sent out a different guy to remeasure and within a week after the remeasure they completely replaced the bad countertop with a new one.\n\nI'm giving these guys a five star review because they probably lost money doing my job.

I will never go there again, big company with no customer service!!!!!!', 'This place was such a headache to deal with. We agreed to a counter top and tile back splash. Our problems started when our salesman did not add the plumbing option on to our order, after we specifically discussed this option. This caused us to have no sink for 2 days, when we were supposed to have no downtime. The upside to this was that we hired a local plumber to do the plumbing for $100 less. Next, our sales man completely ordered the wrong amount of tile for our backsplash. He only ordered 75% of the actual backsplash! It wasn\'t even close. The template person came to measure and never passed along the accurate measurements to the rest of the necessary parties. Even the salesman admitted to me that this company has communication problems (to say the least!). The problems just snowballed from here. The last 25% of tile came in, and was installed. Every single tile had cracks in the glazing. Apparently the (sub-par) installers did not notice any of this and continued to install these cracked tiles. Also, they cut all the tile on our landscaping and did not clean any of it afterwards. So eventually more tiles were ordered and installed. The cracked tiles were removed and replaced. There are still a couple hairline cracks in the glaze, but to be honest it is just not worth it to have them back out. Now, 2 days after the last of the tiles were installed, we find out that 3 outlets in our backsplash no longer work. So that will require we call an electrician to find out what these incompetent installers screwed up this time. From ordering to ""completion"" this entire process was 2.5 months. This place is a headache to deal with, I would not recommend to anyone I care about.', ""This place was amazing from A to Z. First I dealt with two sales people, Robin and Saba: both very professional. I didn't fell pressured at all and they understood the kind of Quartz I was looking for. The warehouse is impressive with more slabs than anywhere else. \nOnce I picked my slab they sent someone to measure: the gentleman was on time, very professional and full of advice. It only took two days to get him in!\nThen I went back to colonial for the layout: that's when you see your slab on the screen with your measurements. You can then choose where your veins are going to be on your real counter.\nThen only one week after I put 50% down the installers were in, at the exact time. These guys were not only professional and super nice but they went beyond since my walls are not straight and I live in a very old house. By the time they left my counters looked perfect!\nI already recommended the place to a friend.\nAdvice: they are very busy so make an appointment.\nThey know what they are doing.""]",6

They have a full set of free weights (2 lb-100+lb) and a myriad of other machines to really crank out the sweat and make you feel the burn. To top all of that off, THEY HAVE AN INDOOR POOL!!!

Well worth a visit.', 'Great beer selection in perfect ambience..servers were quick.  Field games to play between rounds...beware of the ""table"" that is on the fire pit...you could lose a beer glass!!', 'One of my favorite places in Exton and west chester. Great vibe and love all the beers on tap. This is heaven to me, the key to my heart is food and beer and they kill both.', 'If you want a great brew, this is the place to go. Think of it as a bar first and foremost. Otherwise, it\'s a corporate driven restaurant chain that ruins a simple steak salad simply by buying bagged mixed lettuce that is somewhat edible but mostly drab and rotten. If only I was kidding.\n\nNothing is more disappointing than ordering a salad and getting precut, black and brown edged greens with dried out carrot slices. How hard is it to buy lettuce heads and slice them fresh? Let me answer that for you. It\'s not. I do it at home. And it last for days in a Tupperware so don\'t tell me bagged greens are fresher. If I wanted cheap salad I\'d go to McDonalds.\n\nDecide if you\'re going to compete with higher end chains like Outback or stick to bar food and beer if you\'re going to succeed.\n\nUPDATE: I\'m back for the second time and I\'m equally unimpressed. 1) No Oktoberfest on draft and it\'s past the middle of September (Paulaner was kicked). 2) We were put on the wait list and never asked for inside seating or out. It was 66 outside. We got outside and waited even longer for inside. 3) I\'ve been here 2 hours between waiting for a seat and trying to order food. 4) No TP in the ladies room. 5) Was that ""Margarita pizza"" or just sauceless pizza with greenhouse forced crappy tomatoes during tomato season? 6) Our food came out wrong. Again. ""Loved"" the pre-made frozen black bean burger patty. Hubby ordered the fish tacos without cilantro. Came with EXTRA cilantro.\n\nWe won\'t be back.', 'Hubby and I went there last week and had a great time!   Very crowded as it is new but the beer selection was huge!   We also had the pretzel with the beer cheese and the cheese and salami plate, both very tasty and came out rather quickly.  Will definitely return.', 'Wow! We had such a wonderful experience at World of Beer! To begin, World of Beer had extensive outdoor seating that made both of us feel comfortable dining. The outdoor area had tables six feet apart and string lighting for ambiance. The beer menu was also extensive with beers from across the US. They even had BrewDog East Coast Crush which is brewed at my absolute favorite brewery in Ohio. For an appetizer, we ordered the Mac and Cheese bites, which were recommended by our wonderful and attentive waitress, Elizabeth. The breading was delicious and the sriracha lime aioli dipping sauce was a nice addition. For the main course, we both ordered the chipotle chicken sandwich with tater tots. The chicken was moist, the bacon was crispy, and the chipotle sauce added a little kick! I would definitely recommend the tater tots as a side because they were fried to perfection and a change from the usual fries. Based on our positive experience, I predict we will be back at World of Beer in Exton very soon!']",9

Very disappointing since we\'ve always had amazing experiences with Enterprise.', 'RA 641216180\n\nReturn Date: 02-SEP-2018 07:01 PM\n\nRental: Mazda Black CX-5\n\nLocation:  Enterprise Rent-A-Car Reno Tahoe Int. Airport \n\nTotal Amount: $175.92\n\nUpon returning this rental car at the return date and time specified above, I had never endured such a humiliating and horrible customer service experience!  \n\nThe Enterprise Returns Associate said ""this car is questionable"". I asked her, ""what do you mean questionable""?  She went on to say ""its really dusty"".  I looked at the exterior of the vehicle and told her ""this is how the car was presented to me just yesterday.  It wasn\'t presented to me in the best of condition and it was already dirty and dusty when it was given to me"".  It was even given to me in the middle of a garage when she wasn\'t even the original inspector prior to my departure so how does she even know the condition of the vehicle whether it was dusty or not dusty before it was loaned to me? \n\nShe went on and dared to ask me ""did you happen to go to Burning Man"".  I told her, ""does it look like I went to Burning Man.  I\'m wearing white Burberry pants with white Donald J. Pliner shoes with a red buttoned up Ted Baker shirt, so does it look like I went to Burning Man?""  She said ""our rentals are not supposed to go to Burning Man"" like she was implicating where I was not drive even though when I rented the vehicle, nobody ever disclosed locations that were prohibited from visiting that weekend.  I told her again, ""I didn\'t go to Burning Man and I have never been to Burning Man""!!\n\nI went on to tell her that I went to a church conference in Burlingame San Francisco.  She told me, ""well the cars are supposed to be returned the way they were given to the customer"".  I can\'t believe that this Enterprise Rent-A-Car Returns Associate didn\'t even know her own product.  All the cars on the lot are extremely filthy.  Nobody wipes down the vehicle or the glass windows.  She even popped open the hood and was looking with a flashlight very carefully at the engine bay and on the underside of the hood telling the other associate ""do you think the engine is supposed to make that type of noise?  The other associate said ""yes that\'s normal"".  She must have felt as if she just rented me a brand new black vehicle and didn\'t allow a spec of dust on it even though she wasn\'t even the one who witnessed the poor condition the vehicle was in when it was rented to me the day prior.   Unbelievable!!  I wasn\'t even supposed to have a black SUV. I reserved a full-size sedan and the black SUV is what they told me is ""an upgrade"" which I don\'t think it was at all. \n\nShe went ahead and called 2 supervisors from the office location to come inspect the vehicle.  2 men supervisors arrived and quickly looked at the vehicle.  It was like she was trying to blame me for the exterior environment that she thought was dust on a black vehicle or even questioned the authenticity and truthfulness of me telling her that I didn\'t go to Burning Man.  Black cars attract dust in general so maybe black cars should be presented without dust to the customer before their departure.  the one given to me was not. \n\nThe 2 supervisors checked off quickly on the vehicle.  The woman associate then printed my receipt and charged me an extra day and charged an extra day for full insurance damage waiver.  I asked them, ""why did you charge me another day""?  They told me that it was at least 3 hours into the next day so they had to.  \n\nThey even asked me if I wanted to take the car again and return it on 9\\/3 since I already paid for the next day!  Do you actually think that I want to stay driving in a rental vehicle just after the poor customer service I just received from them?  I have several 200 MPH + vehicles sitting in my garage with millions of dollars in my bank account and their asking me if I want to take the rental car for another day after they just gave me all that heat???  WOW!!!!  If I as the President and CEO of Enterprise Rent-A-Car, I would take this company more seriously and discipline employees who don\'t represent the company in a professional matter. I would have fired them on the spot!!!  This is Nevada and the CEO can do that, if you are listening you can can research the Nevada Labor Board for more information.  This is why I\'m taking it online so that higher up officials can read and learn how employees are treating their customers.  I have been renting from Enterprise for 10 years and that was the last rental.  I will now be leaving to go to one of your most rivaled competitors next time I need a rental car to drive to a church conference!\n\nSincerely,\n\nOffended ex-Enterprise customer', 'Some had poor experiences here, but my fianc√© lost her jewelry box in their car and they got it back to us and were very nice the whole time.

I made a call to the Enterprise main line and determined I did in fact have a reservation but discovered in doing so that our great rate was actually because the guy that took our reservation entered the wrong dates. I immediately extended the reservation which bumped our ""too good to be true"" price to almost 150% more than other companies had quoted initially. By this stage we were so close to our reservation date that all other companies had jacked the prices up and could no longer beat Enterprise. I called the Reno Tahoe location once again to confirm that we had a 4WD and the snooty woman on the phone told me they don\'t do 4WD one way. She implied that they would honor it because the main line had booked us in for that though. \nBecause of the mix up in dates, our reservation was now stretching our budget to the limit and I called the main line to ask if they could make the situation right.

The hotel even charged them for the 3rd night, promising they would receive a credit, which they have not seen.  They should have never been charged in the first place.
